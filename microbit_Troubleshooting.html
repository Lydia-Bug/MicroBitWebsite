			<h3 id="stepOne">micro:bit Error Codes</h3>
			<p class="plainText">micro:bit has a <a href="https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/folders/19000163393">Hardware Errors Page</a> to help when your micro:bit displays the following error codes:</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">010</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">The micro:bit's I2C bus is not working, the device might be physically damaged.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Check the micro:bit for any physical damage, ie a missing component. If this is the case, contact the reseller from which you purchased the micro:bit and ask about their replacement process or open a support ticket including a photograph of the front and rear of the device, the DETAILS.TXT file from the micro:bit and any information about the device and editor you are using to program it.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">020</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">There is no free memory on the micro:bit. Your program might be too complex or contain a lot of large variables.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Try reducing your code by making functions out of large sections. If this does not fix the issue, try and find the shortest reproducer of the issue (the smallest bit of code that exhibits the problem) and create a support ticket with the program link or .hex file attached.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">030</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Corruption detected in the micro:bit heap space (memory usually allocated for the storage of variables).</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Try flashing a different .hex file to your device and then try again. Look through your code for any issues.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">040</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">The micro:bit can't execute the script properly.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Flash a different .hex file to it, then try flashing and running your previous program again. Look through your code for any issues.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">042</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">The micro:bit can't execute the script properly.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Flash a different .hex file to it, then try flashing and running your previous program again. Look through your code for any issues.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">043</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">An error occurred with the micro:bit's radio component.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Check the micro:bit for any physical damage, ie a missing component. If this is the case, contact the reseller from which you purchased the micro:bit and ask about their replacement process or open a support ticket.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">050</h4>
			<h4 class="plainText">Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">An error occurred with the micro:bit's accelerometer component.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Check the micro:bit for any physical damage, ie a missing component. If this is the case, contact the reseller from which you purchased the micro:bit and ask about their replacement process or open a support ticket including a photograph of the front and rear of the device, the DETAILS.TXT file from the micro:bit and any information about the device and editor you are using to program it.</p>
			<h4 class="plainText">051</h4>

			<h4>The System LED Does Not Light Up When Powered from Batteries</h4>
			<p class="plainText"><a href="https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000013655-the-system-led-does-not-light-up-when-powered-from-batteries">According to micro:bit</a>, this is normal behaviour. The yellow system LED on the back of the micro:bit will not light up when only running from batteries.</p>
			<p class="plainText">The System LED is powered from the KL26 interface processor (the chip that manages the USB interface on the micro:bit), and this interface processor only powers up when the micro:bit is powered from the USB. When powered from batteries, the KL26 interface processor does not power up, and the System LED will not light up.</p>
			<p class="plainText">If you think there is an issue with the micro:bit, try the following:</p>
			<ol class="plainText">
				<li>Check your batteries work. Try them in another device, if they don't work, replace with some fresh batteries. You can also measure battery capacity to ensure you have enough power to run your program.</li>
				<li>Check the black and red wires that run from the battery pack to the white connector that goes into the micro:bit, make sure there is no damage to them and that the polarity is correct (some JST connectors can be wired in reverse). The red wire going into the terminal should align with the '+' symbol on the silkscreen and black with '-'</li>
				<li>Check that the white JST connector that plugs into the battery socket of the micro:bit is firmly pushed in.</li>
				<li>Check when you plug your micro:bit in via USB that the system LED on the back lights up.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="plainText">If none of these steps help to solve your problem, it looks like your micro:bit might have developed a fault. You should get in contact with the company that you bought it from and check what their returns procedure is.</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">Assertion failed. A MakeCode error that occurs when the condition in an <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/control/assert">assert</a> was false.</p>
			<h4>Resolution</h4>
			<p class="plainText">This is an error introduced through use of the assert function in MakeCode. See the example <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/control/assert">here</a> for usage.</p>
	
			<h3 id="stepThree">Web Python Editor</h3>
			<p class="plainText">The solutions to many micro:bit software issues, like the below, can be found on micro:bit's <a href="https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/folders/19000163392">Software Support Page.</a></p>
			<h4>MicroPython Strange Rounding Error</h4>
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p class="plainText">When I use floating point numbers, I get lots of digits displayed after a number (eg 18.9 gets displayed as 18.89999).</p>
			<h4>Cause</h4>
			<p class="plainText"><a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/issues/367#issuecomment-258059673ß">https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/issues/367#issuecomment-258059673ß</a></p>
			<p class="plainText">The micro:bit uses 30-bit floating point and 18.9 is parsed correctly/accurately but it's then rounded down to 18.899999 when stored in 30 bits.</p>
			<p class="plainText">Floating point numbers are always going to have inaccuracies and you should use formatting like "%.2f" if you want a certain number of digits in the output.</p>
			<h4>Workaround</h4>
			<p class="plainText"><a href="https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000026098-strange-rounding-error">From micro:bit:</a></p>
			
			<pre><code><span class="n">number</span> = <span class="nf">18.9</span>
<span class="n">display</span>.scroll(<span class="mi">"%.1f"</span> % <span class="kn">number</span>)</code></pre>
